# Array Implementation

## Description
Get practice writing classes and implementing functions by implementing some of the essential array functions

## Goal
My goal is to create a data structure and implement push, pop, map, filter, and a deep print in python.

## get_length (Supported)
Get_length will be called from the data-structure and will return the number of items in the data-structure.
 
### push (Supported)
Push will be called from the data-structure and take an object as an argument.  It will add that object to the end of the list. It will return the element if successful, and null if not.

### pop (Not Yet Supported)
Pop will be called from the data-structure.  It will remove and return the last element of the array.

### index(Not Yet Supported)
Index will be called from the data-structure.  It will take a single integer argument and will return the element that is in that position (0 based) or -1 if it does no recieve an integer or the integer is out of bounds.

### map (Not Yet Supported)
Map will be called from the data-structure and will take a function as an argument.  It will call that function on every element and will return the resulting array, deleting elements for which the function returned null or threw an error

### filter (Not Yet Supported)
Filter will be called from the dat-structure and will take a function as an argument.  It will return an array of the elements for which the function returns true.

### deep_print (Not Yet Supported)
Deep_print will be called from the data-structure.  It will print out the objects in the data-structure and each of their attributes to the 100th level.  Optionally, you can pass it an argument to control the level.
